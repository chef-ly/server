Merging your local branch with <dev|prod> will automatically rebuild and relaunch the server. 

From your git hub page you can merge your branch to master:<dev|prod>

Merge un-reviewed changes to dev, to rebuild the dev server and run tests.

Merging the dev branch to prod will rebuild the production server and should only be done after code reviews.
